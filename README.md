# Cry phylogeny
The repository with working codes and supplementary materials for the study of Cry toxins evolution

## Contents 

This repository contains scripts used for statistical processing, phylogeny reconstruction, inferencing recombination events, and analyzing evolutionary selection in the sequences of 3-domain Cry toxins. Please consult the Methods section in the paper for extra details:

## Figures
Figures from the main text are available in the `pics/` directory. For the description, please consult the Results section of the article.

## Supplementary
All supplementary material is located in the `supplementary/` directory. 
`Supplementary_figures.docx` is a Microsoft Word document with a description of all supplementary figures.
`Supplementary_tables.xlsx` is an Exel table with all supplementary tables.

* The `supplementary/pics/` folder contains individual supplementary figures.
* For convenience, in the `supplementary/tables/` folder individual supporting tables in CSV format are provided. For a detailed description of the tables, please consult the `Supplementary_tables.xlsx` file.

## Data
Analyzed data are included in the `data/` directory. The directory contains sequences and phylogenetic trees. Other essential tables obtained when using data processing scripts are presented in the `data_for_scripts/` directory. 
## Data for scripts
For better reproducibility, the data needed for obtaining all the results described in the article is provided in the `data_for_scripts/` directory. The subdirectories are divided according to the subsections in the Results section of the article. The directory `data_for_scripts/for_viz` contains source data required for producing figures in the main text and supplementary material. The presented data could be generated by scripts in the `scripts/` directory. 

## Scripts
The `scripts/` directory includes all code used for pangenome analysis. The scrips are grouped into two categories, namely, those used for data processing and visualization. These groups are further subdivided following the subsections in the Results section of the article. For convenience, required data are presented in the `data_for_script /` directory. Here, commands to run the scripts are presented. The description of input files is given above. For convenience, the data presented in the `data_for_scripts/` is also divided into subdirectories according to sections in the manuscript. The paths for the input files are given relative to the `scripts/` directory.
